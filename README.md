I got the idea for this project when my girlfriend kept telling me that she was losing the names of her patients or other very important information, so I designed MÃ©dicalNote, the first 100% local note taking and pdf saving application.

What will it bring to your organization:

* Better organization of note taking
* 100% secure as the entire application is based on LocalStorage technology
* free :smile:


Of course, the application is not perfect and is in "Beta" I remind you if you want to make changes I am open to any proposal for improvement you can also create a pull request with your additions / changes I will look at all that
